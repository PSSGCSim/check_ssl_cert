 * The host name must now always match with the certificate
 * Fixed the man page, ```README.md``` and ```--help``` output (some options were missing)
 * Short options can be grouped (e.g., ```-vs -c 10 -w 15```)
 * Different verbosity levels can be specified (```-v``` can be used more than once)
 * Added the ```--resolve``` option to specify a custom IP for the checked host
